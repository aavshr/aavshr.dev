title: 'Are we simulated?'

I recently watched the [2016 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgSZA3NPpBs) on whether our universe is a simulation. Some very interesting points about the possibilities of our universe being simulated, what computational resources it may take, whether we can detect if we are being simulated and so on were discussed.

Needless to say, the discussions provoked a number of thoughts in me. One main question I had on this subject (which was not included in the dicussions) was provided that we are simulated, what level of simulation are we on? If our simulators observe that their simulations have evolved consciousness and are questioning their reality wouldn't they themselves start questioning thier reality? If they can simulate beings like us who think, create and mainly, question the reality of their existence, is it not likely that our simulators are also being simulated? And at what point does this stop? Who or what is the ultimate simulator and the ultimate simulation?

If, at some point in the future, humans can simulate a smaller universe within which intelligent life evolve and start doubting the nature of their reality, then, I think, we can almost be certain that we ourselves are simulated.
